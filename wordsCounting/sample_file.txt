In Python 2.x both will give you the same result. The difference between them is that items constructs a list containing the entire contents of the dictionary whereas iteritems gives you an iterator that fetches the items one at a time. In general iteritems is a better choice because it doesn't require so much memory. But here you are sorting the result so it probably won't make any significant difference in this situation. If you are in doubt iteritems is a safe bet. If performance really matters then measure both and see which is fasterIn Python 2.x both will give you the same result.
